# WeldingRobot_6DOF
I have created 6DOF robot for welding purpose as per the assignment requirements. i have used Robotics toolbox (RVC, developed by peter corke) in this project.

Main file is WeldingRobot.m, which contains the code of welding a rectangular shape object. In this file we have generated the workspace of the welding robot.
Capture.PNG is the picture of robot followed and rectangular path.
 
 
 workspace.jpg,  workspace1.jpg, and  workspace2.jpg contains the image of generated workspace for welding robot.
 
 FOR SIMULINK FILE
ff_ControlWeldingRobot.slx contains the simulink  file for control welding robot, and the feedforward and feedback control parts weere implemented.

RoboticsCourseWork_project.pdf contains the questions for this project
